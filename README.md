Input data

Preknowledge: 

-teacher can teach different subject

Constraints:

 - a teacher can teach maximum <limit> times in a week 

 - one room can be used only by one teacher in the sime time slot

 - a teacher can teach one subject in one time slot

 - a teacher can teach only specified subject

 - subject has to be in a timetable <timesPerWeek> times
  
 - teacher cannot teach in <notAvaialableHours>

The population in genetic algorithm is created from timetables.
